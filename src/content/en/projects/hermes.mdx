The first Hermès pop-up store in Brazil was designed by Estudio Guto Requena, blending architecture and technology to create a connection between visitors and the brand.

Interactive graphics, displayed on a window, transform Hermès' visual elements into responsive art that changes with the visitors' emotions and movements. A heartbeat sensor makes the entire space pulse in sync with the visitor's heart, while motion sensors detect the presence of people outside.

I was responsible for the concept of these interactive images and developed the software that generates them in real-time, based on the sensor inputs.
